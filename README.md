# Log Analysis Tool

This Log Analysis Tool will run three queries and return their results as plain text in the terminal.
Three questions are answered by the query results. The queries take time to process, so a notification let's 
the user know the report is processing.

## How to Use Program
`git clone https://github.com/Chrvasq/Logs-Analysis.git`

`python reporting_tool.py`
